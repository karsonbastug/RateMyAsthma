# Six Pages: Website Overview 

## Page 1 The Title Page: 
The first page is our main title page. This page will act as the “brains” of our entire website. The way our website is planned to work, is it will be a website where people can rate how bad their asthma was based on the weather of certain locations (U.S.A only). The first thing you must do is select your city, and then select whether you want reviews for today, past, or if you want to see reviews based on similar conditions for the future. 

## Page 2 Past Weather: 
The second page will be dedicated to reviews of the weather's effect on asthma that are old. This could be useful if you want to see historical averages for a certain city. 

## Page 3 Todays Weather: 
The third page will be focused on reviews and weather information for the current day for your chosen city. This would be useful if you are planning on a day trip somewhere close by, or if you want to check for a friend or loved one. 

## Page 4 Future Weather: 
By utilizing historic weather and weather forecasts, you could see how many reviewed similar weather conditions, even if it hasn’t happened yet. This could be useful as a way for people to plan trips. 

## Page 5 Browse by City: 
This page will allow users to simply browse cities directly and will utilize reviews from any point at all. This could be useful if people just need a direct idea of the city. 

## Page 6 About/QNA: 
We will need a page that clarifies aspects of the website such as people's privacy, its purpose, how to use it, troubleshooting, etc. This will be useful to help answer any questions users might have.
